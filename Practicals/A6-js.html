    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.<br>
    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
